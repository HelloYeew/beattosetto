Beatmap collection sharing website for osu!

## Website link
https://beatsets.info/  

## Description
A website that allows users to post their collection of osu! beatmap set and let other people vote or comment on it. Intended users are osu! players. We choose this project because there is no official website that can do the same job.

You can compare beatmap set collection to playlist and beatmap set to a song.
